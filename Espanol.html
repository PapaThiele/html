<p>
One of my biggest regrets was not listening to my Mom. I don't just mean her advice, wisdom and direction but actually listening to her talk.  My Mom was multi-lingual.  She was fluent in English and Spanish and even knew a little bit of Navajo.  She would use Spanish when she was mad or when the English word just didn't seem to convey the right meaning.  She used a mix of English and Spanish when talking to the cats we had as pets growing up.  It wasn't that I was too cool to learn all but a handful of words in Spanish, I just didn't see the value at the time.  Now that she is gone, I have missed my chance to learn in the easiest way...simple conversation with someone you know.  My children were 6 and almost 4 when she died and they do not remember the one time they met her.  2 years ago we adopted 2 kittens.  Subconsciously, some f the Spanish came back to me.  Along with cat stories I share with them, I try to tell them the words or phrases in Spanish she would use.  It is a way to keep her memory alive and maybe interest my kids in a foreign language.  I started looking up some of the words as they came back to me and compiled them below.
